It’s written like code, but it’s meant to be closer to human speech. Recursion is where a function calls itself. Quote by Leigh Caldwell on Stack Overflow: “Loops may achieve a performance gain for your program. Recursion may achieve a performance gain for your programmer. Choose which is more important in your situation!” every recursive function has two parts: the base case, and the recursive case. Using the stack is convenient because you don’t have to keep track of a pile of boxes yourself—the stack does it for you. but there’s a cost: saving all that info can take up a lot of memory.

Figure out the base case. This should be the simplest possible case. 2. Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case. • Remember, recursion keeps track of the state. • When you’re writing a recursive function involving an array, the base case is often an empty array or an array with one element. If you’re stuck, try that first.

If you’re using D\u0026C on a list, the base case is probably an empty array or an array with one element. • If you’re implementing quicksort, choose a random element as the pivot. The average runtime of quicksort is O(n log n)! • The constant in Big O notation can matter sometimes. That’s why quicksort is faster than merge sort. • The constant almost never matters for simple search versus binary search, because O(log n) is so much faster than O(n) when your list gets big.

Most of us know when a picture is painted well or badly. But being able to recognize good art from bad does not mean that we know how to paint. So too being able to recognize clean code from dirty code does not mean that we know how to write clean code! Writing clean code requires the disciplined use of a myriad little techniques applied through a painstakingly acquired sense of “cleanliness.” This “code-sense” is the key. Some of us are born with it. Some of us have to fight to acquire it. Not only does it let us see whether code is good or bad, but it also shows us the strategy for applying our discipline to transform bad code into clean code.

The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well.\" notes notes: • “elegant.” pleasingly graceful and stylish in appearance or manner; pleasingly ingenious and simple. • efficienc • “tempt.” Bad code tempts the mess to grow! • One broken window starts the process toward decay. • clean code does one thing well • Bad code tries to do too much. Grady Booch quote Grady Booch, author of Object Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications \"Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designer’s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.\" notes notes: • a readability perspective • It should contain only what is necessary. Dave Thomas quote “Big” Dave Thomas, founder of OTI, godfather of the Eclipse strategy \"Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone.\" notes notes: • clean code makes it easy for other people to enhance it. • Code without tests, is not clean. • Smaller is better. • literate: the code should be composed in such a form as to make it readable by humans. Michael Feathers quote Michael Feathers, author of Working Effectively with Legacy Code \"I could list all of the qualities that I notice in clean code, but there is one overarching quality that leads to all of them. Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious that you can do to make it better. All of those things were thought about by the code’s author, and if you try to imagine improvements, you’re led back to where you are, sitting in appreciation of the code someone left for you—code left by someone who cares deeply about the craft.\" notes notes: • paid appropriate attention to details. Ron Jeffries quote Ron Jeffries, author of Extreme Programming Installed and Extreme Programming Adventures in C#. \"In recent years I begin, and nearly end, with Beck’s rules of simple code. In priority order, simple code: • Runs all the tests; • Contains no duplication; • Expresses all the design ideas that are in the system; • Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.\" notes notes: • duplication: it’s a sign that there is an idea in our mind that is not well represented in the code. didn't understand that \"however. I also look at whether an object or method is doing more than one thing. If it’s an object, it probably needs to be broken into two or more objects. If it’s a method, I will always use the Extract Method refactoring on it, resulting in one method that says more clearly what it does, and some submethods saying how it is done.\" • all programs are made up of very similar elements. • Reduced duplication, high expressiveness, and early building of simple abstractions.
